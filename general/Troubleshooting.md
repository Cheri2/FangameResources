# Troubleshooting
## Fangames won't launch!
* Check if non-ASCII (Basically not English alphabets or numbers) characters are included in the directory. This might include your Windows username - Check full directory.
* If jtool is not working, try installing [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=26999).
## Fangames are laggy/running slowly!
* Try [this](https://github.com/omicronrex/dbghelper)
* dbghelper also fixes input lags of some fangames! It's highly recommended to use it on every fangame you download.
## I minimized the game while it's fullscreen, and I can't find it on task bar.
* Find the game on taskmgr, then either kill or maximize the window.
